These texts are useful references both for the course material and the modeling tools we will rely on:

\[Moore\] = _Decision Modeling with Microsoft Excel, Sixth Edition_, by Moore, Weatherford, Eppen, Gould and Schmidt, Prentice Hall

\[Fourier\] = _AMPL A Modeling Language For Mathematical Programming_, by Fourer, Gay, Kernighan, Boyd & Fraser
